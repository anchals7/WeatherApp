# WeatherApp
A weather app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and utilizes Restful APIs. 

Site access: https://anchals7.github.io/WeatherApp/

The front-end is designed with HTML and CSS, and the back-end is designed with JavaScript. 

Usage and Directions:
Enter a city name in the search bar and click on the search icon. 
The weather box will display the searched city's name, temperature (in Celsius), humidity (in percentage), and wind speed (in km/hr). The units are in the metric system.
By default, on the initial page load, San Jose's weather details are displayed (San Jose, CA is my home city).
If an invalid city name is entered, the weather box displays an error message and the user can type in another city name. 

Tools:
No additional frameworks were used. This full-stack project is built only using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
RESTful API, specifically Open Weather's API, was used to get weather details of locations. The API call implementation is in Javascript. 

Additional Features Roadmap:
- Allow user to switch between Dark/Light Mode
- Allow user to switch between metric and imperial units
- Display additional weather details (for example, air quality)
- Improve site accessibility (make the webapp more accessible for users with disabilities)
    - color contrast features
